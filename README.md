# Project: Google Map Scraping

The Google Map Scraping project is designed to extract detailed business information from Google Maps listings. This project uses web scraping techniques to collect structured data, making it easier to analyze businesses, generate leads, and conduct market research. The information gathered supports better decision-making by providing key insights into businesses and services.

## Key Features of the Project

### 1. Business Data Extraction
The scraper collects important business details that are publicly available on Google Maps. This includes:
- **Business Name**: The name of the business.
- **Email**: Email address (if available in the listing).
- **Phone Number**: Contact number of the business.
- **Website URL**: Link to the business's official website.
- **Rating**: Average user rating for the business.
- **Review Count**: Total number of reviews received by the business.

This data can be used for lead generation, targeted outreach, or even competitor analysis.

### 2. Efficiency in Data Collection
By automating the scraping process, the project improves efficiency, saving time compared to manual data entry. The extracted data is structured and organized, making it easy to use in spreadsheets or databases for further analysis or marketing purposes.

### 3. Applications
The data collected can be used in various applications such as:
- **Market Research**: Analyze trends and patterns in specific business categories or regions.
- **Lead Generation**: Gather potential leads with contact information for targeted outreach.
- **Business Analysis**: Study competitors or potential partners by evaluating their Google Maps data.
- **Decision-Making**: Use insights to make informed choices about service providers, local businesses, and more.
